    "This report aims to analyze two different domain's datasets: the *German Credit Risk* and the *Animal Analyzing* dataset. \n",
    "Each dataset presents unique challenges and opportunities \n",
    "for data-driven insights, and the goal is to explore, visualize, and derive actionable conclusions from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the analyze the German Credit Risk is to assess the factors influencing credit risk among indivduals. By examininf features like age, credit history, loan amount, we aim to explore the possible reason and find out the potiental people may have a credit risk. Such an analysis can assist financial institutions in making data-driven lending decisions, improving risk management, and enhancing customer profiling. The audience for this analyze could be decision makers in finanical areas, such as risk managers, and policymakers interested in understanding credit behavior and optimizing risk assessment strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "This Animal Analyze dataset is analyzed to understand animal behavior, characteristics, and classification patterns. The goal is to identify trends, group animals by shared features, and derive insights into their behaviors or ecological roles. This analysis may involve clustering or classification tasks depending on the dataset structure and the research questions. The audience for this analyze could be academics, ecologists, zoologists, and data scientists focused on biological and ecological studies who can leverage the insights for research, conservation planning, or educational purposes.
